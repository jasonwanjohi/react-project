## React Project

The goal of this small project is to create a small webApp displaying users and their related posts (data are located on [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)). 

Use this project, which has already yarn configured and the table of users implemented. The architecture of the project is up to you. Please code as you would do in your everyday work.

#### Specifications

- Add the option to fetch each user posts on [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) and display them with their user.
- The name of each user should be editable, and should send the update to the server (note that the update is faked on jsonplaceholder).
- Display the number of users living in an Appt, and in a Suite (field address.suite)

##### Rules

- add spinners while information is loading
- use open-sourced tools
- utilize any css method (sass, less, css modules, bootstrap, MUI, ...)
- use Redux or any modern state management module
- split the application into different pages
- add tools typically used in a development environment (linters, code formatter, ...)
